- Multi-tenancy: org-level data isolation with `org_id` column on all tables
- Organizations and org_members tables in dashboard database
- OrgDb class for organization CRUD and membership management
- Org-scoped scan CRUD (create, list, delete by org)
- Org-scoped compliance queries (jurisdictions, regulations, requirements, proposals, sources, webhooks)
- X-Org-Id header extraction in compliance service for cross-service org context
- DELETE /api/v1/orgs/:id/data endpoint for org data cleanup
- deleteOrgData() transactional cleanup across all compliance tables
- Organization management admin UI (create, list, delete orgs)
- Organization member management (add, remove, role assignment)
- Org switcher in dashboard sidebar (visible when user belongs to multiple orgs)
- Session org context with POST /orgs/switch endpoint
- GET /orgs/current JSON endpoint for org context
- Dashboard compliance client passes X-Org-Id header on all requests
- deleteOrgData() function in compliance client for org cleanup
- @pally-agent/plugin-notify-slack — Slack notification plugin via webhooks

- Configurable event filtering (subscribe to specific event types)
- @pally-agent/plugin-notify-teams — Microsoft Teams notification plugin via webhooks

### Changed
- ScanRecord now includes orgId field (defaults to 'system')

### Fixed
- adminGuard missing return after reply — allowed handler chain to continue after 403
- Open redirect via unvalidated Referer header in org switch endpoint
- X-Org-Id header now only accepted from API key auth (not JWT) — prevents tenant spoofing
- Scan records now checked for org ownership on direct access — prevents cross-org scan viewing
- Rate limiting added to POST /login (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Org slug validation enforces lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only
- Password no longer trimmed before hashing

- **Redis support** — optional Redis adapter for caching, job queue, and SSE broadcasting (used by compliance service and dashboard when `REDIS_URL` is set)

### Security

- **RSA private key removed** from repository history; keys are now generated at runtime with `pally-compliance keys generate` and stored outside the repo
- **CSRF protection** added to dashboard state-changing routes (SameSite=Strict cookies + origin validation)
- **bcrypt upgraded** from 5.1.1 to 6.x — resolves vulnerable `tar` transitive dependency

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Confirmed violations are now distinguished from notices in compliance reports; notices no longer inflate the confirmed violation count
- WAF detection added to the scan crawl phase — sites blocking scanning with a Web Application Firewall are now detected and reported
- Website hostname included in report filenames (e.g. `example.com-2026-01-15T12-00-00.json`) so filenames are meaningful when multiple sites are scanned

### Changed

- Compliance integration improvements: errors are confirmed violations; notices are flagged separately and never count as violations
- Sitemap XML error handling tightened — malformed sitemaps fall back gracefully to crawl discovery

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- Documentation updated for v0.3.0: hyperlinks to W3C criteria and official legal texts, template deduplication section, compliance integration guide

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **WCAG hyperlinks** — every criterion in the HTML report links to the official W3C Understanding WCAG 2.1 page
- **Regulation hyperlinks** — regulation badges in the HTML report link to official legal texts (EUR-Lex, govinfo.gov, legislation.gov.uk, etc.)
- **Template issue deduplication** — issues appearing on three or more pages are collapsed into a "Template & Layout Issues" section, reducing duplicate noise by ~84%
- **Compliance-enriched reporting** — HTML reports include a legal compliance section with jurisdiction obligations and WCAG descriptions
- **Confirmed vs needs-review** — errors are confirmed violations; notices and warnings are flagged separately

### Fixed

- API route tests added; coverage raised to 80%+
- TypeScript type errors resolved across the compliance and core packages
- `results` key used from pa11y-webservice response (was incorrectly `issues`)
- Default port references in documentation changed from deployment-specific values to the generic default (3000)
