# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24 — v3.1.0 milestone started)

**Core value:** AI-powered accessibility compliance that adapts to each organization's jurisdiction, regulation, and brand context — with admins in control through the dashboard, not config files.
**Current focus:** Phase 41 — openapi-schema-backfill

## Current Position

Phase: 41 (openapi-schema-backfill) — VERIFIED (gaps_found)
Plan: 5 of 5 complete
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-26

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-04-25: Phase 41 (OpenAPI Schema Backfill) added to v3.1.0 — closes Plan 40-01 deferred Task 2 and DOC-02 PARTIAL. Backfills Fastify route schemas across compliance/branding/llm/dashboard/MCP so `/docs` snapshots are substantive and `route-vs-spec` + `openapi-drift` gates pass.
- 2026-04-25: Phase 42 (Installer Wizard Redesign) added to v3.1.0 — Plan 40-07 dry-run on a clean LXC surfaced that all 3 installers were wired for the v2-era codebase. Phase 42 introduces 4 deployment profiles (Scanner CLI / API services / Self-hosted dashboard / Docker Compose), first-class registration of `@luqen/monitor`, plugin axis (auth/notify/storage/git-host) gated by profile, and `install.ps1` parity with `install.sh`. CONTEXT.md captured at scope time.
- 2026-04-26: Phase 41.1 inserted after Phase 41 (URGENT) — Dashboard non-MCP per-route TypeBox schema backfill to close OAPI-04 PARTIAL flagged in 41-VERIFICATION.md (~245 routes; mechanical copy-paste using the infrastructure shipped in 41-04).

### Decisions (carried forward from v3.0.0)

- MCP embedded as Fastify plugin per service, never standalone port
- Streamable HTTP transport only (SSE-only deprecated June 2025)
- AgentService calls service `/mcp` endpoints over HTTP — never direct module imports
- All LLM calls route through existing capability engine at `llm:4200`
- Rolling 20-turn window maintained at write time (not read time)
- char/4 token estimator — being replaced in Phase 34 with precise tokenizer

### Constraints (v3.1.0)

- No new heavy dependencies (tokenizer must stay light, no native binaries, <5 MB bundle impact)
- External MCP clients must keep working unchanged
- Existing conversation rows use legacy token counts; only new conversations get precise counts (per Out of Scope)

### Known Gotchas (carried forward)

- **HTMX OOB inside `<tr>`**: wrap in `<template>` tags
- **HTMX 2.0 `hx-select` inheritance**: use plain JS `EventSource` for streaming, never `hx-sse`
- **`@fastify/rate-limit` 429 bypass**: add `onSend` hook
- **Branding service port**: lxc-luqen runs on port 4100 (not 4300)
- **`issue.context` can be null**: all scorers must null-guard
- **MCP tool schemas must never include orgId** — sourced from ToolContext populated by JWT preHandler
- **MCP prompts use chat-message templates, not tool-call pre-fills**
